let n  = new Promise((resolve)=>{
    resolve();
    console.log(n)
})

/*

The reason console.log(n) doesnâ€™t print the expected value is due to how the JavaScript event loop and Promises work.

In your code:

javascript
Copy code
let n = new Promise((resolve) => {
    resolve();
    console.log(n);  // This line prints immediately
});
Explanation:
Promise Execution:

A Promise is created with the executor function (resolve) => { ... }.
Inside the executor, resolve() is called immediately, which tells the promise that the asynchronous operation is complete.
However, the code after resolve() still runs synchronously.
Synchronous console.log(n):

The console.log(n) line inside the promise executor is executed immediately after resolve() is called. So, at that point, the value of n is still a pending Promise object, not yet resolved.
Promise Resolution Happens Asynchronously:

The resolution of the Promise (i.e., the transition from pending to fulfilled) happens asynchronously. This means that even though you called resolve() inside the executor, the code outside of the executor will run (such as the console.log(n)) before the Promise is actually resolved.
What console.log(n) prints:

Since the Promise has not yet settled when console.log(n) is executed, it prints the Promise object itself, which is still in the pending state. In most JavaScript environments (like modern browsers), this will look something like:
javascript
Copy code
Promise { <pending> }
This is just a representation of the Promise object itself, not its resolved value.

What You Might Expect:
If you want to see the resolved value of the promise (or observe when it has resolved), you should handle it asynchronously using .then() or await.

Correct Approach (Using .then()):
javascript
Copy code
let n = new Promise((resolve) => {
    resolve("Hello, world!");
});

n.then((value) => {
    console.log(value);  // This prints "Hello, world!"
});
In this case:

The resolve() is called with "Hello, world!".
The .then() method waits for the Promise to resolve, and once it's done, the resolved value ("Hello, world!") is passed into the .then() callback, where it is logged.
Alternatively, Using async/await:
javascript
Copy code
async function logPromise() {
    let n = new Promise((resolve) => {
        resolve("Hello, world!");
    });
    
    let result = await n;
    console.log(result);  // This prints "Hello, world!"
}

logPromise();
In this case, the await expression pauses the function execution until the Promise resolves, and then it logs the resolved value.

Summary:
In your code, console.log(n) prints the Promise object before it resolves, showing it as <pending>.
To handle the resolved value of a Promise, you need to use .then() or await to ensure you're working with the value once the Promise has settled.
